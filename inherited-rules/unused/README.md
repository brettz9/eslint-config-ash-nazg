# unused

This directory is for housing an auto-built listing of any configs which have
rules which we have not inherited (or overridden) and are not accounted for
in `explicitly-unused.js`.

This directory will ideally remain empty.

It is built with `npm run unused` (which is also a part of `npm run compare`).
